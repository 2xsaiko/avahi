Please comply with the following rules when hacking on Avahi:

 * When you add a new textual file to the repository please enable SVN
   keyword expansion for it:
       
       svn ps svn:keywords Id foo.c

 * Before commiting check with "svn st" that all built files are ignored
   by svn. To change the list of ignored files 	use 
   
       svn pe svn:ignore .

   This is similar to the ".cvsignore" file in CVS times.

 * Don't forget to add the autoconf config.h inclusion to all C source files:
   
   #ifdef HAVE_CONFIG_H
   #include <config.h>
   #endif

   This needs to be placed in in .c files only. NOT IN HEADER FILES!

 * Don't hardcode any paths in source files. Either use the -D option of gcc
   for C sources or use "sed" to replace them based on a .in file.

 * Never forget that Avahi should be buildable without DBUS, GTK or python!

 * When you code in C, please compile with the following gcc options from time
   to time:
  
   -Wextra
   -Wfloat-equal 
   -Wmissing-declarations
   -Wmissing-prototypes
   -Wstrict-prototypes
   -Wredundant-decls
   -Wold-style-definition
   -Wmissing-noreturn
   -Wdeclaration-after-statement
   -Wshadow
   -Wendif-labels
   -Wlarger-than-4000
   -Wpointer-arith
   -Wbad-function-cast
   -Wcast-qual
   -Wcast-align
   -Wwrite-strings
   -Winline

   This will show you a bunch of issues which might be problems in your source
   code.  Not all options are available on all GCC versions. Just pass these
   options in $CFLAGS when running bootstrap.sh:

   CFLAGS="-Wextra ..." ./bootstrap.sh

 * Whenever you add a new Makefile.am, C (.c or .h) source file, shell or
   python script please add this legal blurb to its header:

   For Makefile.am and python code:
