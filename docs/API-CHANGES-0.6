A terse list of API changes between 0.5.2 and 0.6:

 * Most browsing and registration functions and their callbacks gained
   new "flags" parameters. Passing 0 results in similar behaviour as
   in 0.5.2

 * avahi-client/client.h has been split into client.h, publish.h and lookup.h
 
 * avahi-core/core.h has been split into core.h publish.h lookup.h

 * avahi_client_is_service_local() has been removed. Use instead the special
   flags AVAHI_LOOKUP_RESULT_LOCAL and AVAHI_LOOKUP_RESULT_OUR_OWN which are
   set when resolving or browsing for services. AVAHI_LOOKUP_RESULT_OUR_OWN is
   what most people should use.

 * AVAHI_RESOLVER_TIMEOUT and AVAHI_RESOLVER_NOT_FOUND have been
   removed. Instead AVAHI_RESOLVER_FAILURE is used and the exact error
   code is available from avahi_client_errno()/avahi_server_errno()

 * The events AVAHI_BROWSER_CACHE_EXHAUSTED, AVAHI_BROWSER_ALL_FOR_NOW
   have been introduced. Failures during browsing are now passed as
   AVAHI_BROWSER_FAILURE and the error code is made available through
   avahi_client_errno()/avahi_server_errno().

 * The server gained a new state AVAHI_SERVER_FAILURE if some fatal
   error happens. The reason can be found in
   avahi_server_errno(). Clients can safely ignore this state.

 * You can now update existing records by setting the
   AVAHI_PUBLISH_UPDATE flags for add_service() and friends. Consider
   using avahi_server_update_service_txt_strlst() if you need to
   update only the TXT record for a service.

 * Proper support for service subtypes is now available. Use
   avahi_server_add_service_subtype() for that.

 * Entry groups gained the new state AVAHI_ENTRY_GROUP_FAILURE. The
   reason is available using
   avahi_server_errno()/avahi_client_errno().

 * Many superfluous functions have been removed from the public API or
   entirely.

 * avahi_simple_poll_iterate() has been split up into three
   functions. avahi_simple_poll_loop() has been introduced.

 * Some new limits have been introduced: AVAHI_ADDRESS_STR_MAX,
   AVAHI_DOMAIN_NAME_MAX, AVAHI_LABEL_MAX

 * The functions avahi_service_name_join() and
   avahi_service_name_split() have been introduced.
 
 * AVAHI_ERR_LOCAL_COLLISION has been renamed to AVAHI_ERR_COLLSION

 * The values of AVAHI_PROTO_xxx have changed, they are no longer identical to
   the BSD AF_xxx constants
