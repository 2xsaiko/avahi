Avahi 0.2, the 'Dzie≈Ñ Dobry' release
====================================

 * Unfortunately this release broke the API/ABI of libavahi-client
   with the following function removals

   Removal of these functions may affect users of the 0.1 API
    - avahi_service_resolver_block()

   The following functions were simply for debugging information
   and their removal should not affect anyone
    - avahi_entry_group_get_dbus_path()
    - avahi_domain_browser_get_dbus_path()
    - avahi_service_type_browser_get_dbus_path()
    - avahi_service_browser_get_dbus_path()

   Note that while the libavahi-client API changed slightly, the DBUS
   API itself has only had additions and no existing definitions
   have changed.
 
 * avahi-daemon will now ignore local IP addresses with the "link" scope
   unless it is the only IP address on the interface.
 * avahi-daemon will no longer fail to start if D-BUS is not
   available (if configured with enable-dbus=warn)
 * Fixed a potential crasher when resolving things in libavahi-core.
 * New example demonstrating integration into glib applications
 * Addition new convenience AvahiStringList functions
   avahi_string_list_find()
   avahi_string_list_get_pair()
   avahi_string_list_add_pair()
   avahi_string_list_add_pair_arbitrary()
 * Fixed a typo in avahi-glib.pc that stopped programs using
   the GLIB api from compiling correctly
 * A critical bug in the reflector was fixed where it may go into a
   state of constantly flooding queries out to the network.
 * Introduced new asynchronous resolver API
 * libavahi-client gained an API for resolving HostNames and Addresses
   in addition to the ServiceResolver provided in 0.1
 * Added support for Arch and Gentoo linux distributions.
 * Allowed configuration on non-supported distributions
 * Fixed a critical bug where you cannot use more than one AvahiClient 
   or use it in an application already using D-BUS
 * Fixed assembly of empty string lists to RFC compliant TXT records
 * Added a new service type description database with human
   understandable descriptions of services and translations.
 * Fixed various minor memory corruption bugs
 * Fixed an issue where Avahi might think it encountered a conflict
   if the process or machine has been suspended
 * Fixed compilation and runtime issues on 64-bit distributions
